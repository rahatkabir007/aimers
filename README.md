Project Name - Aimers - A Small Educational Institution Based Website. Details of the project-
1) Creating The JSON File:
- I have created two fake JSON files with 10-12 detailed information to use as API!
- My own JSON file has 10-12 objects in an array!
- I have used different key value for each object to avoid runtime error!
- Every object has its own detailed info about that particular data/object!
2) Creating UI
- I have created the UI dividing into three sections. 1) Heading , 2) Main body & 3) Footer
- My Website Is Mainly Educational Institution based. It has four working pages connected with router!
- Every page has header and footer in common.
- Heading part is divided by two components with their individual JS and CSS files.
- The Heading part has Navbar and A Hero Section to introduce the website to the user.
- Main Body Is divided into three part. 1) About Section 2)Service Section 3) Blog Section.
- - With every nav button we can go to the Service Page, Blog Page And About Page where i showed different type of datas!
